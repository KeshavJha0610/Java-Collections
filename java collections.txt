1.Java collections Framework is a collection of interfaces and classes which helps in storing and processing the data efficiently.
This Framework has several useful classes which have tons of useful functions which makes a programmer task super easy

List:
A list is an ordered collection(sequence).List may contain duplicate elements.
Below are classes implement List interface
1.ArrayList - can grow dynamically,you can access and insert any value in any index.whereas Array has fixed size.
2.LinkedList
3.Vector
and accepts duplicate values

Set:
A set is a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements.However it makes no guarantee concerning the order of iteration
1.HashSet
2.LinkedHashSet
3.Treeset
The above all implements set interface
There is no guarantee that elements are stored in sequential order.random order it is stored

Map:A map is an object that maps keys to values.A map cannot contain duplicate keys.
1.HashMap
2.LinkedHashMap
3.TreeMap


ArrayList:
is dynamic in size.increase by adding or decrease by removing

Hashmap:not thread safe and non synchronized,hashmap allows one null key and any number of null values
Hashmap object values are iterated by using iterator
Hashtable:only one thread or one program can access the Hashtable at a time.Hashtable do not allow null keys and null values in the hashtable object.
Hashtable is the only class other than vector which uses enumerator to iterate the values of HashTable object.

hashmap allocates 16 nodes.works on hashcode/hashing
marks.put("Lisa",300);
Lisa- key
//it will check hashcode of lisa ---2423433
//calculate the index basis of hashcode= 15
//go to particular index and uses .equals() to check the key name - lisa as a key name inside the table
//and we will return the value- Lisa

**hashmap,hashtree,hashtable all work on same principle hashcode.

//immutableMap with only one single entry:

Map<String,Integer> map3 = Collections.singletonMap("test",100);
System.out.println(map3.get("test"));
//map3.put("abc", 200); //unsupportedoperationexception

immutable- cannot be changed.only one single entry using singletonMap

HashMap is not synchronized,not thread safe
